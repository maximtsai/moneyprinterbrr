To run this game...

Method 1:
If you are using Windows software, you can first run runServer8124.exe, then paste "localhost:8124" into the url bar of a web browser to start the game.

Method 2:
Install python. Instructions on doing so can be found here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server 
Once you have python installed, run pythonRunServer.bat or python3RunServer.bat (depending on which version of python you've installed).
The bat file is pointing to port 8124 and you can open it by going to localhost:8124 in a web browser.
